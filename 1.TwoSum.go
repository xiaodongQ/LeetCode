	Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
	You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

	Example:
	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
	return [0, 1].
*/

func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
	mapInt := make(map[int]int)
	for index, i := range nums {
		if mapInt.
	}
}

func main() {

}
